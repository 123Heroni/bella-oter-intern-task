# Bella Otér – Software Intern Task

## Mini Product Discovery Page

This is a mobile-first page that simulates the beginning of the Raven Body Profile experience, following the instructions in the intern test brief. It was built with soft visuals, smooth interaction, and a focus on brand-aligned design.

## What’s Included

- A landing view that asks: “What does your body crave today?”
- Four interactive options: Grounding, Softness, Energy, Freedom
- Each choice reveals:
  - Archetype name
  - Product name and short description
  - Fabric tag
  - A soft-styled product image
- A “Start Over” button resets the view
- Smooth transitions between views
- One custom SVG icon styled to feel clean and gentle
- A localStorage feature that remembers the user's last choice and welcomes them back on reload


## Time Spent

Roughly **3 hours**, including styling, JavaScript logic, image curation, and responsive layout testing.

## If I Had More Time

- I’d add subtle micro-interactions (like hover hint animations or visual confirmation after selection)
- Pull product content from a data file for better scalability
- Add accessibility checks (tab navigation, ARIA labels)
- Write cleaner component-based code if using a framework like React

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Click through the flow and refresh the page to test localStorage

No setup required — just open and test.

## Tools Used

- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **Google Fonts**: DM Serif Display and Inter
- Responsive styling with rems, media queries, and CSS variables


Thanks again for this opportunity — I really enjoyed building this and thinking through the interaction from a user and brand perspective. I'd love the chance to grow with the Bella Otér team and contribute more thoughtfully built experiences like this one.
